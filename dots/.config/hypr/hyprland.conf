# This is problematic, if the laptop is not connected to an external screen, the
# laptop's screen will be off, and if I try to leave it on by default and
# disable it manually, hyprland will crash when I do so. Related but the fix

# monitor=eDP-1, disable

# Add reserved space for status bar

windowrule=noborder,^(Rofi)$
