    # ("-geometry x2"), the message window expands over the whole screen
    # (dmenu-like).  If width is 0, the window expands to the longest
    # message displayed.  A positive x is measured from the left, a
    # negative from the right side of the screen.  Y is measured from
    # the top and down respectively.

    # screen width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.

# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
# Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "category",
# "msg_urgency" and you can override the "timeout", "urgency", "foreground",
# "background", "new_icon" and "format".
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
